    <h1>Backup using ZIP and JS3tream in Windows</h1>
<p>
The good news is, using ZIP and jS3tream together on windows is alot easier than you might think.    All you need to do is zip your files,
and then use JS3tream to send the zip to Amazon.  Just that easy.  If your looking for incremental backups though, I'd suggest you try using
something like tar for that.  Perhaps there is a ZIP utility out there that does incremental backups though.  I'm afraid I just don't know the answer
to that one.

<h2>Create your zip archive</h2>
<p>
 I'm not going to try and explain how to use zip here.  This is beyond the scope of this help file.  Hopefully you have found 
a zip utility that you like to use, and are familiar with.  I'll suggest a few here just to help a bit.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jzip.com/">jZip</a> - Freeware. I have not tried this one, but I have to admit, it looks like a fantastic alternative to
the commercial WinZip</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> - A commercial program, it's been around for a long time, and performs quite well.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> - Freeware. Not a zip program, but rather a complete suite of Unix utilities written for Windows.  It includes a commandline "zip" utility.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now, it's as simple as using one of these utilities, and creating a zip file archive of the files you wish to backup to Amazons s3.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Send to S3</h2>
<p>
  One you have your archive ZIP file, it's time to stream it to S3.  From the command prompt, you simply need to pipe the file through jS3tream with the Windows "type" command.
</p>
<pre class="code">
  type archive.zip | java -jar js3tream.jar -K mykey.txt -b mybucket:archive.zip -i -t "An archive of my music directory"
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Restore from s3</h2>
<p>
  To restore the archived file, we need to fetch it from S3, and redirect it into a file.  The resulting file will be byte for byte,
the same as the zip file you sent previously.  Now, simply extract the zip file to where ever you want, and revel in the fact that
you backed up your data.
</p>
<pre class="code">
java -jar js3tream.jar -K mykey.txt -b mybucket:etc.tgz -o > archive.zip
</pre>
