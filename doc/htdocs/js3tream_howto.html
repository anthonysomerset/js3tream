<a name="keyfile"><h2>How to create and use a key.txt file</h2></a>
<p>It is possible to provide your Amazon S3 ID and Key on the command line with the -k and -s options. But this is not 
a good idea.  On Unix systems, people will be able to fiew the running command line with the "ps" command, and see both
your ID and key.  Not very secure.  By using the -K key.txt option, you can make things alog more secure.  Now, looking
at the "ps" output, you'll only see the reference to a file.  You can now set the file permissions of your key.txt 
file such that only people that should be able to read the file will have access.
</p>
<p>
A key.txt file is a very simple 2 line properties file.  One line for each the key and secret.  Note, the following is
a completely made up key/secret pair.
</p>
<pre class="code">
  key=F83NAF83HFHAP983F3BH
  secret=haf98g87ftad7agfg3g7aa7dfgoao78asgd8fa7sd
</pre>
<p>
  You can now provide this filename to js3tream with the -K option.

<a name="list_buckets"><h2>How to list my archived buckets</h2></a>
<p>
JS3tream can list the buckets you have in your S3 account.  This list is not restricted to only archives you have uploaded using
JS3tream.  This will list ALL of your S3 buckets, regardless of how they were created
</p>
<pre class="code">
  java -jar js3tream.jar --keyfile key.txt --list
</pre>
<p>The resulting output will look something like this</p>
<pre class="code">
2007-01-04 04:11:40 - MyArchiveBucket
2007-11-26 09:33:02 - ABucketOfRandomStuff
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="list_archives"><h2>How to list the files archived within a single bucket</h2></a>
<p>Ok, so you know what S3 bucket you want to look into.  Now, we want to see what archives we have saved to this bucket.
Unlike the command that lists all of our buckets, this command look inside an S3 bucket for data that has been placed there
by JS3tream.  If your bucket contains data not put there by JS3tream, I'm afraid I can't guarantee what this output will do.
So.. It's going to be in your best interest to put archives into a bucket designed to hold jS3tream archives.
</p>
<pre class="code">
  java -jar js3tream.jar --keyfile key.txt --list --bucket MyArchiveBucket
</pre>
<p>The resluting output will reseble this</p>
<pre class="code">
2007-12-01 01:03:45 - MyArchiveBucket:mymusic.tgz - 20.31M in 1 data blocks
2007-11-15 01:03:46 - MyArchiveBucket:moremusic.zip - 19.67M in 1 data blocks
2007-12-01 01:00:30 - MyArchiveBucket:myresume.doc - 19.05k in 1 data blocks

2007-03-06 09:36:17 - MyArchiveBucket:2004-taxes.pdf - 6405.70k in 1 data blocks

2007-03-06 09:44:19 - MyArchiveBucket:2006-taxes.pdf - 2585.29k in 1 data blocks
</pre>
<p>
The output shows alot of info about each archive within the bucket.
<ul>
  <li>The data and time the archive was created.</li>
  <li>The name of the bucket "MyArchiveBucket".</li>
  <li>The optional archive prefix "mymusic.tgz" or "myresume.doc".</li>
  <li>The estimated size of the archive "20.31M" or "19.05k".</li>
  <li>The number of datablocks that make up the specific archive</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="list_chunks"><h2>How to list the data chunks within a single archive</h2></a>
<p>
Ok.. We know how to list our S3 buckets, and how to list the archives within a bucket.  But, what if
we want to see exactly what data blocks make up a specific archive.  When JS3tream sends data to S3, it
sends it in manageable chunks.  If you want to send 100M of data, and with the -z option tell JS3tream to
use 10M chunks, then your archive will be made up of 100/10 data chunks.
</p>
<p>
This is not something that most peple will want to do, sine the resulting output is really just usefull for developers. 
All you need to do is identify the specific archive to inspect, and then provide the "--debug" option.
</p>
<pre class="code">
  java -jar js3tream.jar --keyfile key.txt --list --bucket MyArchiveBucket:home-movies.zip --debug
</pre>
<p>The resulting output will resemble this</p>
<pre class="code">

2007-04-01 05:20:11 - MyArchiveBucket:home-movies.zip - 6667.98M in 267 data blocks
</pre>
<p>
Don't be alarmed that your archive claims to have 267 data blocks, but the last data block has an index code of 000000000000266.  This is because the data blocks start with 0, not 1.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="delete_archive"><h2>How to delete an archive</h2></a>
<p>We've backed up a new copy of our music archive.  Now, it time to delete the old one because we don't want to keep 2 copies.  Or perhaps you do?  Thats your call.  But, in order to delete an archive, we use the -d option.  Note, it is critical that you provide the prefix name of the archive with the ":" in the bucket name.  Without the prefix, JS3tream will attempt to delete the bucket itself.  But don't worry, JS3tream can't delete a non-empty bucket.
</p>
<pre class="code">
 java -jar js3tream.jar --keyfile key.txt --delete --bucket MyArchiveBucket:mymusic.tgz
</pre>
<p>
  Before going through with the delete, JS3tream will give you 10 seconds to cancel the command. 
</p>

<hr>
<a name="delete_bucket"><h2>How to delete an entire bucket</h2></a>
<p>Before you can delete an entire bucket, you must first delete ALL archives within it.  If a bucket is not empty, then
JS3tream will show an error message stating that the bucket must be empty first.  Once you have removed all of the archives
within a bucket, you can delete that bucket.  Note the difference in this command from the command used to delete an archive. 
It is missing the ":" and prefix in the bucket name.
</p>
<pre class="code">
 java -jar js3tream.jar --keyfile key.txt --bucket MyArchiveBucket --delete
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="size"><h2>How to specify the data chunk size</h2></a>
<p>
The default for JS3tream is to send data to S3 in 5M chunks.  For most people, this default will be just fine.  Afterall, the number
of data chunks a single bucket can hold is rather huge.  Infact it's 2<sup>63</sup>-1.  Thats alot of data chunks.  Multiply that by 5M
and we have a number too big for me to calculate in my head.  But.. Lets just say you want to specify the size of the data chunks. 
This is where the -z option comes into play.  simply provide a number "in bytes" you want the chunks to be.
</p>
<p>
 To specify a 25M data chunk size, use the following command.
</p>
<pre class="code">
  type file.tgz | java -jar js3tream -K keyfile -i -b MyArchiveBucket:file.tgz -z 25000000
</pre>
<p>
 There is a catch though.  JS3tream buffers your data in memory before it sends a data chunk to S3.  This means that your process
is going to need enough Java Heap to store the buffer.  If you get an out of memory error from this, then see the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>
</p>


<hr>
<a name="temp_file"><h2>How to use buffer temp files instead of memory buffers</h2></a>
<p>
So, you tried the -z option, and got an OutofMemory error.  Then you read the FAQ and though you'd try to use temp files instead of 
memory buffers.  No problem, simply use the -f option.  This tells JS3tream to buffer your data to a temp file, instead of in memory.
NOTE however, this option slows jS3tream down quite a bit.  temp files are no where near as fast as memory.
</p>


<hr>
<a name="neverdie"><h2>How to use the "neverdie" option</h2></a>
<p>
If your like me, you might have setup a cron job to backup your data on a regular basis.  The "neverdie" option is going to save you some hastles.  JS3tream will automatically attempt to re-send a data chunk that fails to upload.  But, by default, JS3tream will give up trying to send the data after a specific number of tries.  This is a major problem for very large archives.  What if you had gotten to the 184th data chunk, of about 210 data chunks, and JS3tream fails for a simple temporary network problem.  Now you have to start the upload at the start again! No good.
</p>
<p>
The "neverdie" option tells JS3tream to keep on trying to send your data FOREVER!  If a data chunk upload fails, JS3tream will keep on tryin
until either you stop it, or the upload finishes.  Now, temporary internet problems will not mess up your archive process.
