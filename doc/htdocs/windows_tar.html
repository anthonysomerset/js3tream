<h2>Backup using tar and JS3tream in Windows</h2>

<p>I'm sure you are aware that tar is a Unix utility.  But, there are a couple of options for using tar
on the MS Windows platform.
</p>
<p>
My favorite option is the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> package.  It gives you a complete Unix type
shell that runs on Windows.  Cygwin includes the tar utility and many many other common Unix utilities.
</p>
<p>
Another option is a native windows TAR utility like <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tar.htm">Tar for Windows</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Once you have found a version of tar for windows that you like, you can use the <a href="linux_tar.html">Backup using tar and JS3tream in Linux</a> how to as a general
guide.  It might not be an exact match, but you should be able to figure out the difference.
